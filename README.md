Software Engineer Evaluation
============================
Welcome to the second phase of our hiring process. If you've been invited to participate in this evaluation, it means that we found your resume to be interesting, and at least on paper, we believe you would be a good fit for our team.

Our team is muti-diciplinary. We support Intermountain's ERP, HCM, SCM, EPM, WMS functions. There are severl large, commecial software suites that are utilized as the backbone for the work. These systems need direct care and maintenance, and some of them even provide for native customization. Our team also maintains the integrations to these systems. Finally, there also exist 100% custom solutions that either augment processes for the large systems, or fill business needs were commercial solutions either don't meet business requirements or don't exist.

Technologies
============
Here's a smattering of technologies the team is currently utilizing: (in no particular order, and likely not exhaustive)

*ANSI SQL
*Oracle Database
*PL/SQL (Oracle EBusiness Suite, Oracle Application Express)
*SQL Server
*T-SQL (Kronos Analytics, Planon Real-Estate)
*PeopleCode
*SQR
*Cobol
*Java
*Javascript
*CSS
*Scala
*Play Framework
*React
*Angular
*Docker
*Elastic
*Atlassian Suite (Confluence, Jira, Bitbucket)
*Swift (iOS development)
*C# (Microsoft Forms Apps)
*MAXL
*Hyperion Calc Script

The successful candidate need not be an expert at all of these things (that's not likely or reasonable), but should be able and willing to learn if given the time and opportunity.

Why?
====
The intent of this exercise is to see how you think, research, and code. While correctness is important, it's perhaps more important to understand how quickly you can learn something new, and describe your reasoning behind a set of actions you took. In our area we make it a point to enable our business to do what they need to so, and we pride ourselves on the idea that given enough time/resource we could accomplish just about anything. When working with our business counterparts we are challenged not to say *no*, but to figure out how to get to a *yes* that achieves their goals, and is technically feasible.

The Assignment
